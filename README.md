## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open ipynb file
3. install all dependencies

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the XYZ dataset, which contains sensor readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes of smartphones worn by participants during various activities.

## Models
We have implemented and compared several machine learning models for activity recognition, including:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Results
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing human activities from smartphone data.
